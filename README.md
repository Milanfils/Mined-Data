# Mined-Data
EXPLANATION OF H0W THE DATA WAS SCRAPPED

I visted the site to see the position of each required data to be scrapped, I then wrote various functions using multiple python libraries to mine the required columns and rows.


CHALLENGES FACED 

1. The Security Challenges: The site has multiple captcha pop ups, these intermittently affect the flow of the code mining the data. I had to constantly navigate captcha at interval of 60 seconds.

2. Security Challenge : The site has multiple error 403 (request not granted) 

3.Time Constraint: The given time was not enough to scrape as much data as required due to the security challenges


TOOLS USED
1. Python: Pandas, Math, Selenium, chrome Weddriver_manger

2. CSS
